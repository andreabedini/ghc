# The Makefile to build GHC with cabal
#
# Pre-requisites:
# There are a few tools we expect to exist prior to building this.  These are
# documented here.  If you end up creating more dependencies, be explicit about
# them here at the start.
#
#  - make
#  - ghc (a recent enough GHC to function at the boostrap compiler)
#  - cabal (a recent enough cabal-install executable to build the cabal pkgs
#    and the necessary changes for dual stage, ...)
#
# Build Plan:
# In general GHC is built in two stages to ensure the compiler is linked against
# libraries built by the same compiler.  This allows the compiler to have the
# same abi as the code it produces.  This does not work for cross compilers, as
# we can't build a compiler for the host platform using a host->target compiler.
#
# Stage 0 (boostrap stage)
# In this stage we build just enough of the compiler dependencies to build the
# Stage 1 compiler (ghc executable).  We want to build the ghc executable, but
# may need to build extra libraries that are newer than the ones that come with
# the bootstrap compiler.  This crucially also means, these libraries are stable
# (as long as their source doesn't change) to be cached.
#
# Stage 1
# We now have the boostrap libraries and a compiler (ghc1) built with (ghc0) the
# ghc0-libraries + extra libraries built with ghc0.  This includes the new run-
# time system (rts). Thus we have a ghc1 but no libraries yet.  We now build all
# the libraries required to build the compiler (from Ã¸) using ghc1.  And then
# build ghc2 using ghc1 with the newly build libraries.
#
# Stage 2
# This gives us our stage2 compiler (ghc2, all it's deps built with ghc1).  This
# is the pair we package up.

# impact dead-stripability if ghc does not emit subsection via symbols. wtf.
# I remain that `ghc-toolchain` is a bad tool and should just be a configure
# script for ghc-bin producing a `settings` file according to a passed
# `--target`. I also think most of the settins file values should have sensible
# defaults: install_name_tool = install_name_tool, ... that do not need to be
# explicitly listed in the settings file unless you want to override them.

# This is basically the glue piece. We have a compiler `ghc`, that just doesn't have an RTS yet, and thus can't really link any executable.
# Ideally we'd just ask cabal to start building, by providing the boostrap compiler as GHC0 and the stage1 compiler as GHC. However, cabal
# will fall over itself trying to solve the packages even for the build-compiler. E.g. it sees it needs Cabal/Cabal-syntax, which are listed
# as packages in the cabal.project file, then tries to figure out how to build base, ... which just can't work. Ideally the build compiler
# would make a cut wrt to which packages it considers to rebuild. A small closure maybe. Maybe we should re-use non-reinstallable packages
# for this? Although I'd argue, I really don't want those in cabal anymore at some point. Another option would be to have build-packages
# in the cabal-project file, or just outright deny the build-compiler to consider building any of those packages and requesting in that
# special case that people just install --lib the necessary packages as needed? The idea of extending `build-packages` to the cabal.project
# file is growing on me. E.g. consider these packages under `build-packages` eligable to build from source when using the build-compiler
# e.g. for setup, and build-depends.
