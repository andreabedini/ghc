# The Makefile to build GHC with cabal
#
# Pre-requisites:
# There are a few tools we expect to exist prior to building this.  These are
# documented here.  If you end up creating more dependencies, be explicit about
# them here at the start.
#
#  - make
#  - ghc (a recent enough GHC to function at the boostrap compiler)
#  - cabal (a recent enough cabal-install executable to build the cabal pkgs
#    and the necessary changes for dual stage, ...)
#
# Build Plan:
# In general GHC is built in two stages to ensure the compiler is linked against
# libraries built by the same compiler.  This allows the compiler to have the
# same abi as the code it produces.  This does not work for cross compilers, as
# we can't build a compiler for the host platform using a host->target compiler.
#
# Stage 0 (boostrap stage)
# In this stage we build just enough of the compiler dependencies to build the
# Stage 1 compiler (ghc executable).  We want to build the ghc executable, but
# may need to build extra libraries that are newer than the ones that come with
# the bootstrap compiler.  This crucially also means, these libraries are stable
# (as long as their source doesn't change) to be cached.
#
# Stage 1
# We now have the boostrap libraries and a compiler (ghc1) built with (ghc0) the
# ghc0-libraries + extra libraries built with ghc0. Thus we have a ghc1 but no
# libraries yet.  We now build all the libraries required to build the compiler
# (from Ã¸) using ghc1. First we need to build the rts with ghc1. Then build all
# the libraries necessary to build ghc2. And then build ghc2 using ghc1 with the
# newly build libraries.
#
# Stage 2
# This gives us our stage2 compiler (ghc2, all it's deps built with ghc1).  This
# is the pair we package up.

# FIXME: why do they all claim ("target has subsections via symbols","NO") for

# impact dead-stripability if ghc does not emit subsection via symbols. wtf.
# I remain that `ghc-toolchain` is a bad tool and should just be a configure
# script for ghc-bin producing a `settings` file according to a passed
# `--target`. I also think most of the settins file values should have sensible
# defaults: install_name_tool = install_name_tool, ... that do not need to be
# explicitly listed in the settings file unless you want to override them.
